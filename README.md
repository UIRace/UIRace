# UIRace 🚀

UIRace is a real-world frontend challenge platform where developers build beautiful, responsive user interfaces based on provided designs, assets, and constraints like required tech (e.g., Context API, lazy loading, etc.).

Each challenge mimics real project scenarios — helping developers sharpen their UI skills, structure clean code, and grow with production-style practice.
